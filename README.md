# Description

Price Answer requires you to have Auctionator installed, but users sending you price inquiries do not need Auctionator. When playing on Classic Era (both normal and hardcore) servers, Auctionator. This is a much simpler version fo the Price Answer addon by Sygon which supports TradeSkillMaster, if you want TSM and other kind of support use his addon instead.

### Open the settings:

/priceanswer
/prans
Esc > Options > AddOns > Price Answer

People send the following commands to trigger price checks. Thanks to Bearthazar on Curseforge for the better pattern matching in version 1.09, where spaces do not matter. (EXCEPTION: when passing both N and an itemID, a space MUST exist between N and the itemID!!) The trigger price can be changed in the options.

```
price N item
```

Where price is localized, N is an optional quantity (default 1), item is an itemID, itemLink, or item name. If an item name is sent, YOU must have the item in your inventory.
